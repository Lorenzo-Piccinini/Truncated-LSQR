# LSQR

LSQR was first introduced in by Piage and Saunders to solve linear linear systems $Ax=b$ and least squares problems $\min ||Ax-b||_2^2$. 

In our work we present a matrix-oriented version of the algorithm that works wit low rank approximations. We implement the truncation function such that it takes advantage of previous factorizations, leading to 
a cheaper step that otherwise would have been memory and cost requiring.


In order to run the test, rememeber to download first the dataset MNIST.
